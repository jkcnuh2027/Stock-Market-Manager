# Stock-Market-Manager

Currently working on this. I only have the source code up here for now. 

This project will be used to store and sort user information while modifying certain parts or creating serial codes to accurately store transaction data.

C++ will be used and the end goal will be to successfully extract and store transaction data in an external database.
